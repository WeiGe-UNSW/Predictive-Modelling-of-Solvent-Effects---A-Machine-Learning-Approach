# ML-Based Prediction and Interpretation of Drug Loading in Polymer Nanoparticles
This repository contains the dataset and Python code used in the study:
**“Data-Driven Prediction and Interpretation of Drug Encapsulation and Loading Capacity in Polymer Nanoparticles”

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between solvent physicochemical properties and nanoparticle performance (Encapsulation Efficiency, EE% and Drug Loading Capacity, DLC%) using multiple machine learning models. The final model (Multilayer Perceptron, MLP) was optimized and interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the most influential features governing drug loading outcomes.

## Repository Contents
- `data/Data.csv` – Preprocessed input dataset with physicochemical descriptors.

- `notebooks/MLP_hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb` – Hyperparameter tuning workflow for MLP model.
- `notebooks/SHAP_analysis.ipynb` – SHAP value computation and visualization for EE% and DLC%.


## Requirements
This project supports Python 3.7 through 3.10 and requires the following packages:
- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `shap` 

## Dataset Description
Each row in the dataset represents a unique solvent condition used for nanoparticle formulation.  
The dataset includes the following **input features**:

- **Curcumin solubility**
- **Hansen solubility parameters**: δd (dispersion), δp (polar), δh (hydrogen bonding)
- **Hildebrand solubility parameter**
- **Dielectric constant**
- **Viscosity**
- **Dipole moment**
- **Polarity**

The following are the **target outputs**:

- **EE%** – Encapsulation Efficiency  
- **DLC%** – Drug Loading Capacity
